ArchiveExtract App:

This C# UWP App archives and extracts folders and files located in a User selected folder.  User can select compression level to use when archiving items.

This App requires library files LibMainPageCommon.cs and LibZipArchive.cs located in Library-Files-for-other-Repository-Apps to be linked under folder named 'Library' to compile.

I no longer intend to support this App so placing code on GitHub so others can use if useful.
